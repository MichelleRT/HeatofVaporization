# HeatofVaporization

This repository contains two classifiers: one for heat of vaporization and the other
for vapor pressure. These two classifiers are extremely similar, except for their 
respective values. 

Note: the classifiers use random forest classification and the PaDEL-Descriptor.jar file.
